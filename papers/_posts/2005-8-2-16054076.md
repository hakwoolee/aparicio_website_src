# Abstract

Recent genetic evidence in humans and from mouse knockouts has linked kisspeptin-driven GPR54 signaling to the regulation of GnRH release from the hypothalamus. These molecules appear to represent a previously unsuspected control point for GnRH secretion, with important implications for the biology and pathology of the sex steroid axis.
