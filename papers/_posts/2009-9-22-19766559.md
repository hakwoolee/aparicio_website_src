# Abstract

Identifying new regulators of the stem cell state offers potential for future gains in biomedicine. Evidence that the tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of the stem cell state (Cicalese et al., 2009) suggests a broad role for this protein and its pathways in the control of normal tissue homeostasis and tumor formation.
