# Abstract

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are now being widely used in cancer research and have the potential to greatly inform our understanding of cancer biology. However, many questions remain, especially regarding the ability of PDX models to affect clinical decision making. With these points in mind, we asked three scientists to give their opinions on the generation and uses of PDX models and the future of this field.
