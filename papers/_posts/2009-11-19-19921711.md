# Abstract

Next-generation DNA sequencing devices have revolutionized cancer genomics by bringing whole genome resequencing of patients' tumours within practical and economic reach. We present an overview of the techniques involved and review early results from the resequencing of cancer genomes. The possible impacts of whole-genome and trancriptome resequencing in clinical cancer research and the practice of pathology are discussed.
