I am a Biomedical Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo and my interests lie in bioinformatics data analysis and software design. I am currently working as a software engineer at the Aparicio lab at BC Cancer. My primary work focuses include bioinformatics software design, cloud computing/infrastructure support and miscellaneous day-to-day tasks.
