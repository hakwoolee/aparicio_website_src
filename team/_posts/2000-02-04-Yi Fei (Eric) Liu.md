Eric is a 4th year undergraduate student studying pharmacology the University of British Columbia. Currently a co-op student, he hopes to continue with the lab for his directed studies as well as postgraduate studies in cancer research further down the road. In his free time, Eric enjoys staying active outdoors and following Formula 1. 

In the Aparicio Lab, Eric performs high throughput drug screening of patient-derived xenograft organoids. This is a model system that better recapitulates the heterogeneity of the corresponding human disease while also retaining many key advantages of traditional cancer cell lines. This project aims to identify clinically actionable genomic deficiencies in triple-negative breast cancers.
