I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Statistics, University of British Columbia, and the Department of Molecular Oncology, BC Cancer Agency, where I'm supervised by Sohrab Shah and Alexandre Bouchard-Côté. My research focuses on Bayesian models and scalable inference for single-cell and cancer genomics. Previously I was a PhD student at Oxford University supervised by Chris Yau.
