Dr. Shah received a PhD in computer science from UBC in 2008 and was appointed as a Principal Investigator to the BC Cancer Agency and the University of British Columbia in 2010 and as Chief of Computational Oncology in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 2018. He holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Cancer Genomics, and is the recipient of both a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Career Investigator Award and a Terry Fox Research Institute New Investigator Award. His research focuses on understanding how tumours evolve over time through integrative approaches involving genomics and computational modeling. He has made seminal contributions to understanding of clonal evolution in ovarian cancer and discovered that specific mutational patterns in the genomes of ovarian cancers are prognostic in terms of treatment outcomes. Dr. Shah has also pioneered computational methods for inference of mutations in cancer genomes as well as deciphering patterns of cancer evolution. He has led development of novel Bayesian statistical models, algorithms, and computational approaches to analyze large, high dimensional genomics and transcriptomic data sets, from both patient tumours and model systems. This includes advancing molecular profiling of cancer cells at single cell resolution4. Dr. Shah has been at the forefront of studying tumor evolution in breast, ovary and lymphoid malignancies. His work has been published in Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Methods, NEJM, Genome Research, Genome Biology, amongst others. Dr. Shah oversees an annual budget of >$1M in competitively awarded funding from philanthropic, government and international bodies.
