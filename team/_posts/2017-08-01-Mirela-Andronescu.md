I am interested in designing computational algorithms to better understand biological changes in cancer. I am currently involved in designing probabilistic algorithms to find clones in very sparse single-cell DNA methylation data. I pursued my post-doc with Bill Noble in the Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, where I worked on statistical and computational methods to process and understand high-throughput pairwise chromatin interaction data. I received my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, in the area of RNA secondary structure prediction and thermodynamic parameter estimation.
