I am a statistician and currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology at the [BC Cancer Agency Research Centre](http://www.bccrc.ca/). I completed my PhD in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of Nancy Heckman. I am originally from Brazil where I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s Degrees in Statistics at the University of Campinas. My main research areas of interest include method development and analysis of genomic data, single-cell sequencing, nonparametric regression, functional data analysis, density estimation, machine learning, latent variable modelling and applications to energy consumption data.
