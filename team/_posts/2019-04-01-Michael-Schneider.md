I am a visiting PhD student from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, and am particularly interested in the development and application of statistical and computational tools to better understand complex biological issues such as cancer evolution. I am funded by the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions programme under the [CONTRA network](https://itn-contra.org/).
