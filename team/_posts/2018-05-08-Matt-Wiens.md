I'm an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University, working through
a joint honours in Applied Mathematics and Engineering Physics. With
this degree I'm able to split my time pretty much evenly between (mostly
continuous) mathematics, theoretical physics, and electronics
engineering; the three combined feel like home for me, and I wouldn't
have it any other way. I'll likely be pursuing graduate studies after my
undergraduate degree, though I haven't yet decided which field I'd like
to specialize inâ€”for now I'm keeping an open mind.

When I'm not studying for my courses, I enjoy working on projects,
hacking in hackathons, and competing in programming competitions.

Also, I copy-pasted this bio from my website, which you can find
[here](http://mattwiens.ca) if you like.
