Adrian has a background in molecular biology and biochemistry and has a passion for building teams. As the Laboratory Research and Operations Manager, he is responsible for the day-to-day activities/functions of the Aparicio research laboratory and a team of technicians, as well as overseeing the departmental responsibilities and the safety of 160+ staff members. In 2019, Adrian received his MBA from Simon Fraser University in Management of Technology. He believes technology will play a big role in all businesses in the near future. Finding a way to harness and deploy technologies in academic research, where funding is limited, will help drive efficiencies and increase productivity in academic setting and biotechnology sectors. Outside of work, Adrian's interest includes traveling, cooking, and playing sports (mostly hockey).
