In October 2018, Spencer joined the Computational Oncology group at Memorial Sloan Kettering as a Bioinformatics Software Engineer. He works with Dr. Sohrab Shah on projects related to data visualization and database management. Prior to working at MSK, Spencer was a member of the Shah Lab in Vancouver, BC from September 2017 to April 2018 for an undergraduate internship. He graduated in August 2018 from the University of Victoria with a BSc in Computer Science, and is excited to explore the opportunities that MSK and New York have to offer.
