LID - 310
AB  - Subsets of breast tumors present major clinical challenges, including
      triple-negative, metastatic/recurrent disease and rare histologies. Here, we
      developed 37 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from these difficult-to-treat
      cancers to interrogate their molecular composition and functional biology.
      Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays
      revealed that PDXs conserve the molecular landscape of their corresponding
      patient tumors. Metastatic potential varied between PDXs, where low-penetrance
      lung micrometastases were most common, though a subset of models displayed high
      rates of dissemination in organotropic or diffuse patterns consistent with what
      was observed clinically. Chemosensitivity profiling was performed in vivo with
      standard-of-care agents, where multi-drug chemoresistance was retained upon
      xenotransplantation. Consolidating chemogenomic data identified actionable
      features in the majority of PDXs, and marked regressions were observed in a
      subset that was evaluated in vivo. Together, this clinically-annotated PDX
      library with comprehensive molecular and phenotypic profiling serves as a
      resource for preclinical studies on difficult-to-treat breast tumors.

      stress granule formation.
LID - 165
AB  - The RNA helicase EIF4A3 regulates the exon junction complex and nonsense-mediated
      mRNA decay functions in RNA transcript processing. However, a transcriptome-wide 
      network definition of these functions has been lacking, in part due to the lack
      of suitable pharmacological inhibitors. Here we employ short-duration graded
      EIF4A3 inhibition using small molecule allosteric inhibitors to define the
      transcriptome-wide dependencies of EIF4A3. We thus define conserved cellular
      functions, such as cell cycle control, that are EIF4A3 dependent. We show that
      EIF4A3-dependent splicing reactions have a distinct genome-wide pattern of
      associated RNA-binding protein motifs. We also uncover an unanticipated role of
      EIF4A3 in the biology of RNA stress granules, which sequester and silence the
      translation of most mRNAs under stress conditions and are implicated in cell
      survival and tumour progression. We show that stress granule induction and
      maintenance is suppressed on the inhibition of EIF4A3, in part through
      EIF4A3-associated regulation of G3BP1 and TIA1 scaffold protein expression.

AB  - Measuring gene expression of tumor clones at single-cell resolution links
      functional consequences to somatic alterations. Without scalable methods to
      simultaneously assay DNA and RNA from the same single cell, parallel single-cell 
      DNA and RNA measurements from independent cell populations must be mapped for
      genome-transcriptome association. We present clonealign, which assigns gene
      expression states to cancer clones using single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing
      independently sampled from a heterogeneous population. We apply clonealign to
      triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenografts and high-grade serous
      ovarian cancer cell lines and discover clone-specific dysregulated biological
      pathways not visible using either sequencing method alone.Electronic

TI  - Engineered in-vitro cell line mixtures and robust evaluation of computational
      methods for clonal decomposition and longitudinal dynamics in cancer.
LID - 13467
AB  - Characterization and quantification of tumour clonal populations over time via
      longitudinal sampling are essential components in understanding and predicting
      the response to therapeutic interventions. Computational methods for inferring
      tumour clonal composition from deep-targeted sequencing data are ubiquitous,
      however due to the lack of a ground truth biological data, evaluating their
      performance is difficult. In this work, we generate a benchmark data set that
      simulates tumour longitudinal growth and heterogeneity by in vitro mixing of
      cancer cell lines with known proportions. We apply four different algorithms to
      our ground truth data set and assess their performance in inferring clonal
      composition using different metrics. We also analyse the performance of these
      algorithms on breast tumour xenograft samples. We conclude that methods that can 
      simultaneously analyse multiple samples while accounting for copy number
      alterations as a factor in allelic measurements exhibit the most accurate
      predictions. These results will inform future functional genomics oriented
      studies of model systems where time series measurements in the context of
      therapeutic interventions are becoming increasingly common. These studies will
      need computational models which accurately reflect the multi-factorial nature of 
      allele measurement in cancer including, as we show here, segmental aneuploidies.

TI  - CDK12 regulates alternative last exon mRNA splicing and promotes breast cancer
      cell invasion.
PG  - 6698-716
AB  - CDK12 (cyclin-dependent kinase 12) is a regulatory kinase with evolutionarily
      conserved roles in modulating transcription elongation. Recent tumor genome
      studies of breast and ovarian cancers highlighted recurrent CDK12 mutations,
      which have been shown to disrupt DNA repair in cell-based assays. In breast
      cancers, CDK12 is also frequently co-amplified with the HER2 (ERBB2) oncogene.
      The mechanisms underlying functions of CDK12 in general and in cancer remain
      poorly defined. Based on global analysis of mRNA transcripts in normal and breast
      cancer cell lines with and without CDK12 amplification, we demonstrate that CDK12
      primarily regulates alternative last exon (ALE) splicing, a specialized subtype
      of alternative mRNA splicing, that is both gene- and cell type-specific. These
      are unusual properties for spliceosome regulatory factors, which typically
      regulate multiple forms of alternative splicing in a global manner. In breast
      cancer cells, regulation by CDK12 modulates ALE splicing of the DNA damage
      response activator ATM and a DNAJB6 isoform that influences cell invasion and
      tumorigenesis in xenografts. We found that there is a direct correlation between 
      CDK12 levels, DNAJB6 isoform levels and the migration capacity and invasiveness
      of breast tumor cells. This suggests that CDK12 gene amplification can contribute
      to the pathogenesis of the cancer.

TI  - ddClone: joint statistical inference of clonal populations from single cell and
      bulk tumour sequencing data.
LID - 44
AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bulk tumour tissue can identify constituent
      cell populations in cancers and measure their abundance. This requires
      computational deconvolution of allelic counts from somatic mutations, which may
      be incapable of fully resolving the underlying population structure. Single cell 
      sequencing (SCS) is a more direct method, although its replacement of NGS is
      impeded by technical noise and sampling limitations. We propose ddClone, which
      analytically integrates NGS and SCS data, leveraging their complementary
      attributes through joint statistical inference. We show on real and simulated
      datasets that ddClone produces more accurate results than can be achieved by
      either method alone.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this

TI  - CX-5461 is a DNA G-quadruplex stabilizer with selective lethality in BRCA1/2
      deficient tumours.
LID - 14432
AB  - G-quadruplex DNAs form four-stranded helical structures and are proposed to play 
      key roles in different cellular processes. Targeting G-quadruplex DNAs for cancer
      treatment is a very promising prospect. Here, we show that CX-5461 is a
      G-quadruplex stabilizer, with specific toxicity against BRCA deficiencies in
      cancer cells and polyclonal patient-derived xenograft models, including tumours
      resistant to PARP inhibition. Exposure to CX-5461, and its related drug CX-3543, 
      blocks replication forks and induces ssDNA gaps or breaks. The BRCA and NHEJ
      pathways are required for the repair of CX-5461 and CX-3543-induced DNA damage
      and failure to do so leads to lethality. These data strengthen the concept of G4 
      targeting as a therapeutic approach, specifically for targeting HR and NHEJ
      deficient cancers and other tumours deficient for DNA damage repair. CX-5461 is
      now in advanced phase I clinical trial for patients with BRCA1/2 deficient
      tumours (Canadian trial, NCT02719977, opened May 2016).

TI  - Direct Transcriptional Consequences of Somatic Mutation in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 2032-46
AB  - Disordered transcriptomes of cancer encompass direct effects of somatic mutation 
      on transcription, coordinated secondary pathway alterations, and increased
      transcriptional noise. To catalog the rules governing how somatic mutation exerts
      direct transcriptional effects, we developed an exhaustive pipeline for analyzing
      RNA sequencing data, which we integrated with whole genomes from 23 breast
      cancers. Using X-inactivation analyses, we found that cancer cells are more
      transcriptionally active than intermixed stromal cells. This is especially true
      in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. Overall, 59% of substitutions were
      expressed. Nonsense mutations showed lower expression levels than expected, with 
      patterns characteristic of nonsense-mediated decay. 14% of 4,234 rearrangements
      caused transcriptional abnormalities, including exon skips, exon reusage,
      fusions, and premature polyadenylation. We found productive, stable transcription
      from sense-to-antisense gene fusions and gene-to-intergenic rearrangements,
      suggesting that these mutation classes drive more transcriptional disruption than
      previously suspected. Systematic integration of transcriptome with genome data
      reveals the rules by which transcriptional machinery interprets somatic mutation.

      amplification on planar substrates.
PG  - 8484-9
AB  - The study of cell-to-cell genomic differences in complex multicellular systems
      such as cancer requires genome sequencing of large numbers of single cells. This 
      in turn necessitates the uniform amplification of single-cell genomes with high
      reproducibility across large numbers of cells, which remains an outstanding
      challenge. Here, we introduce a method that uses commercially available liquid
      dispensing to perform inexpensive and high-throughput single-cell whole genome
      amplification (WGA) in nanoliter volumes. For the first time, to our knowledge,
      we demonstrate robust and highly uniform nanoliter-volume single-cell WGA across 
      a large replicate set consisting of more than 100 single cells. Comparison with
      previous datasets shows that this method improves uniformity and achieves levels 
      of genome coverage and genomic variant detection comparable or superior to
      existing methods.

TI  - Combined Use of Gene Expression Modeling and siRNA Screening Identifies Genes and
      Pathways Which Enhance the Activity of Cisplatin When Added at No Effect Levels
      to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells In Vitro.
LID - e0150675
AB  - Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While cisplatin is effective, its use is not 
      curative and resistance often emerges. As a consequence of microenvironmental
      heterogeneity, many tumour cells are exposed to sub-lethal doses of cisplatin.
      Further, genomic heterogeneity and unique tumor cell sub-populations with reduced
      sensitivities to cisplatin play a role in its effectiveness within a site of
      tumor growth. Being exposed to sub-lethal doses will induce changes in gene
      expression that contribute to the tumour cell’s ability to survive and eventually
      contribute to the selective pressures leading to cisplatin resistance. Such
      changes in gene expression, therefore, may contribute to cytoprotective
      mechanisms. Here, we report on studies designed to uncover how tumour cells
      respond to sub-lethal doses of cisplatin. A microarray study revealed changes in 
      gene expressions that occurred when A549 cells were exposed to a
      no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of cisplatin (e.g. the IC10). These data were
      integrated with results from a genome-wide siRNA screen looking for novel
      therapeutic targets that when inhibited transformed a NOEL of cisplatin into one 
      that induced significant increases in lethality. Pathway analyses were performed 
      to identify pathways that could be targeted to enhance cisplatin activity. We
      found that over 100 genes were differentially expressed when A549 cells were
      exposed to a NOEL of cisplatin. Pathways associated with apoptosis and DNA repair
      were activated. The siRNA screen revealed the importance of the hedgehog, cell
      cycle regulation, and insulin action pathways in A549 cell survival and response 
      to cisplatin treatment. Results from both datasets suggest that RRM2B, CABYR,
      ALDH3A1, and FHL2 could be further explored as cisplatin-enhancing gene targets. 
      Finally, pathways involved in repairing double-strand DNA breaks and INO80
      chromatin remodeling were enriched in both datasets, warranting further research 
      into combinations of cisplatin and therapeutics targeting these pathways.

      types.
LID - 8554
AB  - We present a novel hierarchical Bayes statistical model, xseq, to systematically 
      quantify the impact of somatic mutations on expression profiles. We establish the
      theoretical framework and robust inference characteristics of the method using
      computational benchmarking. We then use xseq to analyse thousands of tumour data 
      sets available through The Cancer Genome Atlas, to systematically quantify
      somatic mutations impacting expression profiles. We identify 30 novel cis-effect 
      tumour suppressor gene candidates, enriched in loss-of-function mutations and
      biallelic inactivation. Analysis of trans-effects of mutations and copy number
      alterations with xseq identifies mutations in 150 genes impacting expression
      networks, with 89 novel predictions. We reveal two important novel
      characteristics of mutation impact on expression: (1) patients harbouring known
      driver mutations exhibit different downstream gene expression consequences; (2)
      expression patterns for some mutations are stable across tumour types. These
      results have critical implications for identification and interpretation of
      mutations with consequent impact on transcription in cancer.

AB  - Given the success of targeted agents in specific populations it is expected that 
      some degree of molecular biomarker testing will become standard of care for many,

      experimenting with targeted “panel” sequencing of selected mutations. Recent

      for individual patients. Recognizing the risk, inherent in panel sequencing, of
      failing to detect meaningful somatic alterations, we sought to establish
      processes to integrate data from whole-genome analysis (WGA) into routine cancer 
      care. Between June 2012 and August 2014, 100 adult patients with incurable
      cancers consented to participate in the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) study.
      Fresh tumor and blood samples were obtained and used for whole-genome and RNA
      sequencing. Computational approaches were used to identify candidate driver
      mutations, genes, and pathways. Diagnostic and drug information were then sought 
      based on these candidate “drivers.” Reports were generated and discussed weekly
      in a multidisciplinary team setting. Other multidisciplinary working groups were 
      assembled to establish guidelines on the interpretation, communication, and
      integration of individual genomic findings into patient care. Of 78 patients for 
      whom WGA was possible, results were considered actionable in 55 cases. In 23 of
      these 55 cases, the patients received treatments motivated by WGA. Our experience
      indicates that a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists can
      implement a paradigm in which WGA is integrated into the care of late stage
      cancer patients to inform systemic therapy decisions.

TI  - A co-culture genome-wide RNAi screen with mammary epithelial cells reveals
      transmembrane signals required for growth and differentiation.
LID - 4
AB  - Introduction: The extracellular signals regulating mammary epithelial cell growth
      are of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of mammary epithelia, yet
      they remain poorly characterized. In this study, we applied an unbiased approach 
      to understanding the functional role of signalling molecules in several models of
      normal physiological growth and translated these results to the biological
      understanding of breast cancer subtypes. Methods: We developed and utilized a
      cytogenetically normal clonal line of hTERT immortalized human mammary epithelial
      cells in a fibroblast-enhanced co-culture assay to conduct a genome-wide small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for evaluation of the functional effect of
      silencing each gene. Our selected endpoint was inhibition of growth. In rigorous 
      postscreen validation processes, including quantitative RT-PCR, to ensure
      on-target silencing, deconvolution of pooled siRNAs and independent confirmation 
      of effects with lentiviral short-hairpin RNA constructs, we identified a subset
      of genes required for mammary epithelial cell growth. Using three-dimensional
      Matrigel growth and differentiation assays and primary human mammary epithelial
      cell colony assays, we confirmed that these growth effects were not limited to
      the 184-hTERT cell line. We utilized the METABRIC dataset of 1,998 breast cancer 
      patients to evaluate both the differential expression of these genes across
      breast cancer subtypes and their prognostic significance. Results: We identified 
      47 genes that are critically important for fibroblast-enhanced mammary epithelial
      cell growth. This group was enriched for several axonal guidance molecules and G 
      protein–coupled receptors, as well as for the endothelin receptor PROCR. The
      majority of genes (43 of 47) identified in two dimensions were also required for 
      three-dimensional growth, with HSD17B2, SNN and PROCR showing greater than
      tenfold reductions in acinar formation. Several genes, including PROCR and the
      neuronal pathfinding molecules EFNA4 and NTN1, were also required for proper
      differentiation and polarization in three-dimensional cultures. The 47 genes
      identified showed a significant nonrandom enrichment for differential expression 
      among 10 molecular subtypes of breast cancer sampled from 1,998 patients. CD79A, 
      SERPINH1, KCNJ5 and TMEM14C exhibited breast cancer subtype–independent overall
      survival differences. Conclusion: Diverse transmembrane signals are required for 
      mammary epithelial cell growth in two-dimensional and three-dimensional
      conditions. Strikingly, we define novel roles for axonal pathfinding receptors
      and ligands and the endothelin receptor in both growth and differentiation.

TI  - DNA barcoding reveals diverse growth kinetics of human breast tumour subclones in
      serially passaged xenografts.
LID - 5871
AB  - Genomic and phenotypic analyses indicate extensive intra- as well as intertumoral
      heterogeneity in primary human malignant cell populations despite their clonal
      origin. Cellular DNA barcoding offers a powerful and unbiased alternative to
      track the number and size of multiple subclones within a single human tumour
      xenograft and their response to continued in vivo passaging. Using this approach 
      we find clone-initiating cell frequencies that vary from ~1/10 to ~1/10,000 cells
      transplanted for two human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer xenografts 
      derived from three different patients. For the cell lines, these frequencies are 
      negatively affected in transplants of more than 20,000 cells. Serial transplants 
      reveal five clonal growth patterns (unchanging, expanding, diminishing,
      fluctuating or of delayed onset), whose predominance is highly variable both
      between and within original samples. This study thus demonstrates the high growth
      potential and diverse growth properties of xenografted human breast cancer cells.

TI  - Impact of MLL5 expression on decitabine efficacy and DNA methylation in acute
      myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1456-64
AB  - Hypomethylating agents are widely used in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
      and unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia. However, it is not well
      understood why only some patients respond to hypomethylating agents. We found
      previously that the effect of decitabine on hematopoietic stem cell viability
      differed between Mll5 wild-type and null cells. We, therefore, investigated the
      role of MLL5 expression levels on outcome of acute myeloid leukemia patients who 
      were treated with decitabine. MLL5 above the median expression level predicted
      longer overall survival independent of DNMT3A mutation status in bivariate
      analysis (median overall survival for high vs. low MLL5 expression 292 vs. 167
      days; P=0.026). In patients who received three or more courses decitabine, high
      MLL5 expression and wild-type DNMT3A independently predicted improved overall
      survival (median overall survival for high vs. low MLL5 expression 468 vs. 243
      days; P=0.012). In transformed murine cells, loss of Mll5 was associated with
      resistance to low-dose decitabine, less global DNA methylation in promoter
      regions, and reduced DNA demethylation upon decitabine treatment. Together, these
      data support our clinical observation of improved outcome in decitabine-treated
      patients who express MLL5 at high levels, and suggest a mechanistic role of MLL5 
      in the regulation of DNA methylation.

TI  - Insulin-like peptide 5 is an orexigenic gastrointestinal hormone.
PG  - 11133-8
AB  - Hormonal factors from specialized enteroendocrine cells in the gut epithelium
      link the availability of dietary nutrients to energy utilization and storage.
      Many gut hormones also affect behaviors such as appetite and foraging, conveying 
      for example the satiating effects of food consumption. Here we identify
      insulin-like peptide 5 (Insl5) as a product of colonic endocrine L-cells, and
      show that levels were elevated in calorie-restricted mice and reduced after
      feeding. Consistent with this profile Insl5 administration stimulated food intake
      in mice, indicating it should join ghrelin as only the second identified gut
      hormone that enhances appetite. Modulating the Insl5 axis presents a new strategy
      for the treatment of metabolic disease and obesity.

TI  - Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer.
PG  - 415-21
AB  - All cancers are caused by somatic mutations. However, understanding of the
      biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of
      somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational
      processes that have been operative. Here, we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from
      7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are
      present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family
      of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single class. Certain
      signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known
      mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic
      origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation
      localized to small genomic regions, kataegis, is found in many cancer types. The 
      results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development
      of cancer with potential implications for understanding of cancer etiology,
      prevention and therapy.

TI  - DriverNet: uncovering the impact of somatic driver mutations on transcriptional
      networks in cancer.
PG  - R124
AB  - Simultaneous interrogation of tumor genomes and transcriptomes is underway in
      unprecedented global efforts. Yet, despite the essential need to separate driver 
      mutations modulating gene expression networks from transcriptionally inert
      passenger mutations, robust computational methods to ascertain the impact of
      individual mutations on transcriptional networks are underdeveloped. We introduce
      a novel computational framework, DriverNet, to identify likely driver mutations
      by virtue of their effect on mRNA expression networks. Application to four cancer
      datasets reveals the prevalence of rare candidate driver mutations associated
      with disrupted transcriptional networks and a simultaneous modulation of
      oncogenic and metabolic networks, induced by copy number co-modification of
      adjacent oncogenic and metabolic drivers. DriverNet is available on Bioconductor 
      or at http://compbio.bccrc.ca/software/drivernet/.

TI  - Mutational Processes Molding the Genomes of 21 Breast Cancers.
PG  - 979-93
AB  - All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes
      reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their
      precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated
      catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical
      methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple
      distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. 
      Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of
      substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex 
      relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were
      detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed “kataegis,” 
      was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually
      colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were
      almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying
      most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC
      family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. PaperClip:

TI  - The landscape of cancer genes and mutational processes in breast cancer.
PG  - 400-4
AB  - All cancers carry somatic mutations in their genomes. A subset, known as driver
      mutations, confer clonal selective advantage on cancer cells and are causally
      implicated in oncogenesis1, and the remainder are passenger mutations. The driver
      mutations and mutational processes operative in breast cancer have not yet been
      comprehensively explored. Here we examine the genomes of 100 tumours for somatic 
      copy number changes and mutations in the coding exons of protein-coding genes.
      The number of somatic mutations varied markedly between individual tumours. We
      found strong correlations between mutation number, age at which cancer was
      diagnosed and cancer histological grade, and observed multiple mutational
      signatures, including one present in about ten per cent of tumours characterized 
      by numerous mutations of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Driver mutations were
      identified in several new cancer genes including AKT2, ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B,
      MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1 and TBX3. Among the 100 tumours, we found driver 
      mutations in at least 40 cancer genes and 73 different combinations of mutated
      cancer genes. The results highlight the substantial genetic diversity underlying 
      this common disease.

TI  - The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel

PG  - 346-52
AB  - The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers requires
      integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from representative numbers of
      patients. We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in
      a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours,
      respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number 
      variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number
      aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ~40% of genes, with the
      landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression
      outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes,
      including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired 
      DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which 
      reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk,
      oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable
      prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to
      modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated
      adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific
      chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel
      molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact
      of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.

TI  - The clonal and mutational evolution spectrum of primary triple negative breast
      cancers.
LID - 10.1038/nature10933
AB  - Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) represent approximately 16% of all 
      breast cancers1 and are a tumour type defined by exclusion, for which
      comprehensive landscapes of somatic mutation have not been determined. Here we
      show in 104 early TNBC cases, that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit
      a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some exhibiting only a 
      handful of somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds
      of somatic events and multiple pathways implicated. Integration with matched
      whole transcriptome sequence data revealed that only ~36% of mutations are
      expressed. By examining single nucleotide variant (SNV) allelic abundance derived
      from deep re-sequencing (median >20,000 fold) measurements in 2414 somatic
      mutations, we determine for the first time in an epithelial tumour, the relative 
      abundance of clonal genotypes among cases in the population. We show that TNBC
      vary widely and continuously in their clonal frequencies at the time of
      diagnosis, with basal subtype TNBC2,3 exhibiting more variation than non-basal
      TNBC. Although p53 and PIK3CA/PTEN somatic mutations appear clonally dominant
      compared with other pathways, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are
      incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal and cell
      shape/motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting they
      occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together our results show that
      future attempts to dissect the biology and therapeutic responses of TNBC will
      require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.

TI  - Feature-based classifiers for somatic mutation detection in tumour–normal paired 
      sequencing data.
PG  - 167-75
AB  - Motivation: The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using
      next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to profile tumours for single
      nucleotide variant (SNV) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published
      bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic
      mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding
      intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of
      accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour/normal NGS data remains
      an unsolved challenge.Results: We present the comparison of four standard
      supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction 
      in tumour/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest,
      Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic
      regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs
      from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and
      subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the
      classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354
      non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these
      methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both
      exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms
      employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved
      the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant
      margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth ‘false
      positive’ predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence
      suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important 
      directions for future study.Availability: Software called MutationSeq and
      datasets are available from

TI  - Mll5 Is Required for Normal Spermatogenesis.
LID - e27127
AB  - Background: Mll5 is currently a member of the Mll family of SET domain histone
      methyltransferase proteins but studies have also showed that it could be part of 
      the SET3 branch of proteins. Recently, constitutive knock out animal studies have
      shown that Mll5 is required for proper haematopoietic stem cell differentiation, 
      and loss of Mll5 results in synthetic lethality for genome de-methylation. Mll5
      deficient male mice are infertile and here we analyse the consequences of Mll5
      deficiency for spermatogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mll5 deficient
      male mice, but not female mice, are infertile. Here we show using RNA in-situ
      hybridization that Mll5 is expressed in the germ cells of the testes of wild type
      mice. Consistent with the expression of Mll5, we demonstrate by electron
      microscopy, video microscopy and in vitro fertilisation techniques that Mll5
      deficient mice have defects in terminal maturation and packaging of sperm. The
      defects seen include detachment of the acrosomal cap and impaired excess
      cytoplasm removal. Functional tests of sperm motility show a lack of progressive 
      motility of spermatozoa from Mll5 deficient animals. None of these defects could 
      be rescued by in vitro fertilization. Using microarray analysis we show that
      transcripts implicated in spermatogenesis are dysregulated.
      Conclusions/Significance: Our data demonstrate a clear role of Mll5 in mammalian 
      spermatogenesis at the level of terminal differentiation providing further
      support for its classification in the SET3 branch of proteins. Moreover, this
      study identifies Tlk2, Utx, Gpr64, Sult4a1, Rap2ip, Vstm2 and HoxA10 as possible 
      Mll5 targets that together may account for the observed spermatozoa maturation
      defects.

TI  - Somatic mutations at EZH2 Y641 act dominantly through a mechanism of selectively

PG  - 2451-9
AB  - Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell
      lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the
      histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal
      quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a
      dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma
      samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of
      histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N
      mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. 
      Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby
      structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease
      affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially
      favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of
      reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in
      monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative
      to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a
      disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase,
      whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase,
      rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests
      that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for 
      this disease.

TI  - ARID1A Mutations in Endometriosis-Associated Ovarian Carcinomas.
PG  - 1532-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian clear-cell and endometrioid carcinomas may arise from
      endometriosis, but the molecular events involved in this transformation have not 
      been described. METHODS: We sequenced the whole transcriptomes of 18 ovarian
      clear-cell carcinomas and 1 ovarian clear-cell carcinoma cell line and found
      somatic mutations in ARID1A (the AT-rich interactive domain 1A [SWI-like] gene)
      in 6 of the samples. ARID1A encodes BAF250a, a key component of the SWI–SNF
      chromatin remodeling complex. We sequenced ARID1A in an additional 210 ovarian
      carcinomas and a second ovarian clear-cell carcinoma cell line and measured
      BAF250a expression by means of immunohistochemical analysis in an additional 455 
      ovarian carcinomas. RESULTS: ARID1A mutations were seen in 55 of 119 ovarian
      clear-cell carcinomas (46%), 10 of 33 endometrioid carcinomas (30%), and none of 
      the 76 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Seventeen carcinomas had two somatic
      mutations each. Loss of the BAF250a protein correlated strongly with the ovarian 
      clear-cell carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma subtypes and the presence of
      ARID1A mutations. In two patients, ARID1A mutations and loss of BAF250a
      expression were evident in the tumor and contiguous atypical endometriosis but
      not in distant endometriotic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate ARID1A as
      a tumor-suppressor gene frequently disrupted in ovarian clear-cell and
      endometrioid carcinomas. Since ARID1A mutation and loss of BAF250a can be seen in
      the preneoplastic lesions, we speculate that this is an early event in the
      transformation of endometriosis into cancer. (Funded by the British Columbia
      Cancer Foundation and the Vancouver General Hospital–University of British

TI  - Inter-observer reproducibility of HER2 immunohistochemical assessment and
      concordance with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): pathologist assessment
      compared to quantitative image analysis.
PG  - 165
AB  - Background: In breast cancer patients, HER2 overexpression is routinely assessed 
      by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and equivocal cases are subject to fluorescent in
      situ hybridization (FISH). Our study compares HER2 scoring by histopathologists
      with automated quantitation of staining, and determines the concordance of IHC
      scores with FISH results. Methods: A tissue microarray was constructed from 1,212
      invasive breast carcinoma cases with linked treatment and outcome information.
      IHC slides were semi-quantitatively scored by two independent pathologists on a
      range of 0 to 3+, and also analyzed with an Ariol automated system by two
      operators. 616 cases were scorable by both IHC and FISH. Results: Using data from
      unequivocal positive (3+) or negative (0, 1+) results, both visual and automated 
      scores were highly consistent: there was excellent concordance between two
      pathologists (kappa = 1.000, 95% CI: 1-1), between two machines (kappa = 1.000,
      95% CI: 1-1), and between both visual and both machine scores (kappa = 0.898, 95%
      CI: 0.775–0.979). Two pathologists successfully distinguished negative, positive 
      and equivocal cases (kappa = 0.929, 95% CI: 0.909–0.946), with excellent
      agreement with machine 1 scores (kappa = 0.835, 95% CI: 0.806–0.862; kappa =
      0.837, 95% CI: 0.81–0.862), and good agreement with machine 2 scores (kappa =
      0.698, 95% CI: 0.6723–0.723; kappa = 0.709, 95% CI: 0.684–0.732), whereas the two
      machines showed good agreement (kappa = 0.806, 95% CI: 0.785–0.826). When
      comparing categorized IHC scores and FISH results, the agreement was excellent
      for visual 1 (kappa = 0.814, 95% CI: 0.768–0.856), good for visual 2 (kappa =
      0.763, 95% CI: 0.712–0.81) and machine 1 (kappa = 0.665, 95% CI: 0.609–0.718),
      and moderate for machine 2 (kappa = 0.535, 95% CI: 0.485–0.584). Conclusion: A
      fully automated image analysis system run by an experienced operator can provide 
      results consistent with visual HER2 scoring. Further development of such systems 
      will likely improve the accuracy of detection and categorization of membranous
      staining, making this technique suitable for use in quality assurance programs
      and eventually in clinical practice.

TI  - Kisspeptin and GPR54 immunoreactivity in a cohort of 518 patients defines
      favourable prognosis and clear cell subtype in ovarian carcinoma.
PG  - 33
AB  - Background: Kisspeptins and their G-protein coupled receptor, GPR54 are required 
      for GnRH release and have been associated with anti-metastatic tumour cell
      behaviour in model systems. The latter might suggest that their overexpression
      would be associated with a better prognosis in cancer. However, kisspeptin/GPR54 
      interactions (autocrine, paracrine, and/or endocrine) could also impact tumour
      behaviour in a negative manner. Here, for the first time, we associate the
      immunoreactivity of the kisspeptin/GPR54 ligand-receptor pair with favourable
      prognosis in a large cohort of ovarian carcinomas. Methods: Immunohistochemical
      analysis for kisspeptin and GPR54 was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA)
      consisting of 518 early stage ovarian carcinomas, all with linked clinical
      outcome data. The TMA was scored using a staining intensity scale of 0
      (negative), +1 (mild-moderate), and +2 (strong). Strong staining cases were
      considered either kisspeptin or GPR54 positive and designated as 1, while all
      other cases were considered negative and designated 0. All statistical analysis
      was conducted using two-sided tests and a p value equal to or less than 0.05 was 
      considered significant. Results: Kisspeptin and GPR54 immunoreactive cases show a
      favourable prognosis in univariable disease specific survival (p = 0.0023, p =
      0.0092), as well as in overall survival (p = 0.0006, p = 0.0002). Furthermore,
      kisspeptin is an independent marker for favourable prognosis as determined by
      multivariable disease specific (p = 0.0046) and overall survival analysis (p =
      0.0170), while GPR54 is an independent marker for overall survival only (p =
      0.0303). Both kisspeptin positive and GPR54 positive cases are strongly
      associated with the ovarian carcinoma clear cell subtype (p < 0.0001, p <
      0.0001), and GPR54 is significantly associated with favourable prognosis in
      overall survival within the clear cell subtype (p = 0.0102). Conclusion:
      Kisspeptin and GPR54 immunoreactivity are significantly associated with
      favourable prognosis in both disease specific and overall survival, as well as
      being significantly associated with the clear cell ovarian carcinoma subtype,
      thereby creating the first independent prognostic biomarkers specific for ovarian
      clear cell carcinomas.

TI  - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in mice lacking a functional Kiss1 gene.
PG  - 10714-9
AB  - The G protein-coupled receptor GPR54 (AXOR12, OT7T175) is central to acquisition 
      of reproductive competency in mammals. Peptide ligands (kisspeptins) for this
      receptor are encoded by the Kiss1 gene, and administration of exogenous
      kisspeptins stimulates hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release
      in several species, including humans. To establish that kisspeptins are the
      authentic agonists of GPR54 in vivo and to determine whether these ligands have
      additional physiological functions we have generated mice with a targeted
      disruption of the Kiss1 gene. Kiss1-null mice are viable and healthy with no
      apparent abnormalities but fail to undergo sexual maturation. Mutant female mice 
      do not progress through the estrous cycle, have thread-like uteri and small
      ovaries, and do not produce mature Graffian follicles. Mutant males have small
      testes, and spermatogenesis arrests mainly at the early haploid spermatid stage. 
      Both sexes have low circulating gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone and
      follicle-stimulating hormone) and sex steroid (β-estradiol or testosterone)
      hormone levels. Migration of GnRH neurons into the hypothalamus appears normal
      with appropriate axonal connections to the median eminence and total GnRH
      content. The hypothalamic–pituitary axis is functional in these mice as shown by 
      robust luteinizing hormone secretion after peripheral administration of
      kisspeptin. The virtually identical phenotype of Gpr54- and Kiss1-null mice
      provides direct proof that kisspeptins are the true physiological ligand for the 
      GPR54 receptor in vivo. Kiss1 also does not seem to play a vital role in any
      other physiological processes other than activation of the
      hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and loss of Kiss1 cannot be overcome by
      compensatory mechanisms.

      cells by modulation of PUMA/p21 levels.
PG  - 7386-91
AB  - Activation of the tumor suppressor p53 by DNA damage induces either cell cycle
      arrest or apoptosis, but what determines the choice between cytostasis and death 
      is not clear. In this report, we show that the E1A-binding p300 nucleoprotein is 
      a key determinant of p53-dependent cell fate in colorectal cancer cells: absence 
      of p300 increases apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition,
      p300-deficient (p300-) cells fail to undergo G1/S arrest after UV irradiation.
      These abnormalities are associated with prolongation of p53 stability, reduced
      p53-acetylation, blunting of MDM2 activation, failure to transactivate p21, and a
      disproportionate increase in PUMA levels. When xenografted, p300- cells are more 
      sensitive to chemotherapy with doxorubicin. These results show that p300 is a key
      regulator of the p53 response and suggest that p300 inhibition could be used to
      modulate chemotherapy.

TI  - Expression microarray reproducibility is improved by optimising purification
      steps in RNA amplification and labelling.
PG  - 9
AB  - Background: Expression microarrays have evolved into a powerful tool with great
      potential for clinical application and therefore reliability of data is
      essential. RNA amplification is used when the amount of starting material is
      scarce, as is frequently the case with clinical samples. Purification steps are
      critical in RNA amplification and labelling protocols, and there is a lack of
      sufficient data to validate and optimise the process. Results: Here the
      purification steps involved in the protocol for indirect labelling of amplified
      RNA are evaluated and the experimentally determined best method for each step
      with respect to yield, purity, size distribution of the transcripts, and dye
      coupling is used to generate targets tested in replicate hybridisations. DNase
      treatment of diluted total RNA samples followed by phenol extraction is the
      optimal way to remove genomic DNA contamination. Purification of double-stranded 
      cDNA is best achieved by phenol extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation 
      at room temperature. Extraction with guanidinium-phenol and Lithium Chloride
      precipitation are the optimal methods for purification of amplified RNA and
      labelled aRNA respectively. Conclusion: This protocol provides targets that
      generate highly reproducible microarray data with good representation of
      transcripts across the size spectrum and a coefficient of repeatability
      significantly better than that reported previously.

TI  - Epiclomal: Probabilistic clustering of sparse single-cell DNA methylation data.
LID - e1008270
AB  - We present Epiclomal, a probabilistic clustering method arising from a
      hierarchical mixture model to simultaneously cluster sparse single-cell DNA
      methylation data and impute missing values. Using synthetic and published
      single-cell CpG datasets, we show that Epiclomal outperforms non-probabilistic
      methods and can handle the inherent missing data characteristic that dominates
      single-cell CpG genome sequences. Using newly generated single-cell 5mCpG
      sequencing data, we show that Epiclomal discovers sub-clonal methylation patterns
      in aneuploid tumour genomes, thus defining epiclones that can match or transcend 
      copy number-determined clonal lineages and opening up an important form of clonal
      analysis in cancer. Epiclomal is written in R and Python and is available at
      https://github.com/shahcompbio/Epiclomal.

TI  - Probabilistic cell-type assignment of single-cell RNA-seq for tumor
      microenvironment profiling.
PG  - 1007-15
AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled decomposition of complex
      tissues into functionally distinct cell types. Often, investigators wish to
      assign cells to cell types, performed through unsupervised clustering followed by
      manual annotation, or via “mapping” procedures to existing data. However, manual 
      interpretation scales poorly to large datasets, mapping approaches require
      purified or pre-annotated data, and both are prone to batch effects. To overcome 
      these issues we present CellAssign (www.github.com/irrationone/cellassign), a
      probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to
      annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined or de novo cell types. CellAssign
      automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large
      datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects. We demonstrate the
      advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and analysis of tumor
      microenvironment composition in high grade serous ovarian cancer and follicular
      lymphoma.

TI  - Eleven grand challenges in single-cell data science.
LID - 31
AB  - The recent boom in microfluidics and combinatorial indexing strategies, combined 
      with low sequencing costs, has empowered single-cell sequencing technology.
      Thousands—or even millions—of cells analyzed in a single experiment amount to a
      data revolution in single-cell biology and pose unique data science problems.
      Here, we outline eleven challenges that will be central to bringing this emerging
      field of single-cell data science forward. For each challenge, we highlight
      motivating research questions, review prior work, and formulate open problems.
      This compendium is for established researchers, newcomers, and students alike,
      highlighting interesting and rewarding problems for the coming years.

AB  - Accurate measurement of clonal genotypes, mutational processes, and replication
      states from individual tumor-cell genomes will facilitate improved understanding 
      of tumor evolution. We have developed DLP+, a scalable single-cell whole-genome
      sequencing platform implemented using commodity instruments, image-based object
      recognition, and open source computational methods. Using DLP+, we have generated
      a resource of 51,926 single-cell genomes and matched cell images from diverse
      cell types including cell lines, xenografts, and diagnostic samples with limited 
      material. From this resource we have defined variation in mitotic mis-segregation
      rates across tissue types and genotypes. Analysis of matched genomic and image
      measurements revealed correlations between cellular morphology and genome ploidy 
      states. Aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles allowed for calculation
      of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inference of clonal
      phylogenies and avoided the limitations of bulk deconvolution. Finally, joint
      analysis over the above features defined clone-specific chromosomal aneuploidy in
      polyclonal populations.

TI  - Dissociation of solid tumor tissues with cold active protease for single-cell
      RNA-seq minimizes conserved collagenase-associated stress responses.
LID - 210
AB  - Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for
      studying complex biological systems, such as tumor heterogeneity and tissue
      microenvironments. However, the sources of technical and biological variation in 
      primary solid tumor tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNA-seq
      are not well understood. Results: We use low temperature (6 °C) protease and
      collagenase (37 °C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with
      tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNA-seq dataset comprising 155,165 cells
      from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts, and cancer
      cell lines. We observe substantial variation in standard quality control metrics 
      of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From the contrast between tissue
      protease dissociation at 37 °C or 6 °C, we observe that collagenase digestion
      results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and
      stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37 °C),
      which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6 °C). While
      induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell
      type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient
      tissues. Conclusions: The method and conditions of tumor dissociation influence
      cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue- and cell-type dependent. 
      Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single-cell
      studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, 
      may be especially confounded. We define a core set of 512 genes that can assist
      with the identification of such effects in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments.

PG  - 578-92
AB  - Increasing evidence of functional and transcriptional heterogeneity in
      phenotypically similar cells examined individually has prompted interest in
      obtaining parallel methylome data. We describe the development and application of
      such a protocol to index-sorted murine and human hematopoietic cells that are
      highly enriched in their content of functionally defined stem cells. Utilizing an
      optimized single-cell bisulfite sequencing protocol, we obtained quantitative DNA
      methylation measurements of up to 5.7 million CpGs in single hematopoietic cells.
      In parallel, we developed an analytical strategy (PDclust) to define single-cell 
      DNA methylation states through pairwise comparisons of single-CpG methylation
      measurements. PDclust revealed that a single-cell epigenetic state can be
      described by a small (<1%) stochastically sampled fraction of CpGs and that these
      states are reflective of cell identity and state. Using relationships revealed by
      PDclust, we derive near complete methylomes for epigenetically distinct
      subpopulations of hematopoietic cells enriched for functional stem cell content.

TI  - Atrophin controls developmental signaling pathways via interactions with
      Trithorax-like.
LID - e23084
AB  - Mutations in human Atrophin1, a transcriptional corepressor, cause
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Drosophila
      Atrophin (Atro) mutants display many phenotypes, including neurodegeneration,
      segmentation, patterning and planar polarity defects. Despite Atro’s critical
      role in development and disease, relatively little is known about Atro’s binding 
      partners and downstream targets. We present the first genomic analysis of Atro
      using ChIP-seq against endogenous Atro. ChIP-seq identified 1300 potential direct
      targets of Atro including engrailed, and components of the Dpp and Notch
      signaling pathways. We show that Atro regulates Dpp and Notch signaling in larval
      imaginal discs, at least partially via regulation of thickveins and fringe. In
      addition, bioinformatics analyses, sequential ChIP and coimmunoprecipitation
      experiments reveal that Atro interacts with the Drosophila GAGA Factor,
      Trithorax-like (Trl), and they bind to the same loci simultaneously. Phenotypic
      analyses of Trl and Atro clones suggest that Atro is required to modulate the
      transcription activation by Trl in larval imaginal discs. Taken together, these
      data indicate that Atro is a major Trl cofactor that functions to moderate
      developmental gene transcription.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23084.001

TI  - CLK-dependent exon recognition and conjoined gene formation revealed with a novel
      small molecule inhibitor.
LID - 7
AB  - CDC-like kinase phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich proteins is central to
      RNA splicing reactions. Yet, the genomic network of CDC-like kinase-dependent RNA
      processing events remains poorly defined. Here, we explore the connectivity of
      genomic CDC-like kinase splicing functions by applying graduated, short-exposure,
      pharmacological CDC-like kinase inhibition using a novel small molecule (T3) with
      very high potency, selectivity, and cell-based stability. Using RNA-Seq, we
      define CDC-like kinase-responsive alternative splicing events, the large majority
      of which monotonically increase or decrease with increasing CDC-like kinase
      inhibition. We show that distinct RNA-binding motifs are associated with T3
      response in skipped exons. Unexpectedly, we observe dose-dependent conjoined gene
      transcription, which is associated with motif enrichment in the last and second
      exons of upstream and downstream partners, respectively. siRNA knockdown of
      CLK2-associated genes significantly increases conjoined gene formation.
      Collectively, our results reveal an unexpected role for CDC-like kinase in
      conjoined gene formation, via regulation of 3′-end processing and associated
      splicing factors.

TI  - Patient-derived Xenograft (PDX) Models In Basic and Translational Breast Cancer
      Research.
PG  - 547-73
AB  - Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of a growing spectrum of cancers are
      rapidly supplanting long-established traditional cell lines as preferred models
      for conducting basic and translational pre-clinical research. In breast cancer,
      to complement the now curated collection of approximately 45 long-established
      human breast cancer cell lines, a newly formed consortium of academic
      laboratories, currently from Europe, Australia, and North America, herein
      summarizes data on over 500 stably transplantable PDX models representing all
      three clinical subtypes of breast cancer (ER+, HER2+, and “Triple-negative”
      (TNBC)). Many of these models are well-characterized with respect to genomic,
      transcriptomic, and proteomic features, metastatic behavior, and treatment
      response to a variety of standard-of-care and experimental therapeutics. These
      stably transplantable PDX lines are generally available for dissemination to
      laboratories conducting translational research, and contact information for each 
      collection is provided. This review summarizes current experiences related to PDX
      generation across participating groups, efforts to develop data standards for
      annotation and dissemination of patient clinical information that does not
      compromise patient privacy, efforts to develop complementary data standards for
      annotation of PDX characteristics and biology, and progress toward
      “credentialing” of PDX models as surrogates to represent individual patients for 
      use in pre-clinical and co-clinical translational research. In addition, this
      review highlights important unresolved questions, as well as current limitations,
      that have hampered more efficient generation of PDX lines and more rapid adoption
      of PDX use in translational breast cancer research.

PG  - 260-274.e22
AB  - The inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of breast cancer needs to be adequately 
      captured in pre-clinical models. We have created a large collection of breast
      cancer patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs), in which the morphological and
      molecular characteristics of the originating tumor are preserved through
      passaging in the mouse. An integrated platform combining in vivo maintenance of
      these PDTXs along with short-term cultures of PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs)
      was optimized. Remarkably, the intra-tumor genomic clonal architecture present in
      the originating breast cancers was mostly preserved upon serial passaging in
      xenografts and in short-term cultured PDTCs. We assessed drug responses in PDTCs 
      on a high-throughput platform and validated several ex vivo responses in vivo.
      The biobank represents a powerful resource for pre-clinical breast cancer
      pharmacogenomic studies (http://caldaslab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/bcape), including
      identification of biomarkers of response or resistance.

TI  - Genome co-amplification upregulates a mitotic gene network activity that predicts
      outcome and response to mitotic protein inhibitors in breast cancer.
LID - 70
AB  - Background: High mitotic activity is associated with the genesis and progression 
      of many cancers. Small molecule inhibitors of mitotic apparatus proteins are now 
      being developed and evaluated clinically as anticancer agents. With clinical
      trials of several of these experimental compounds underway, it is important to
      understand the molecular mechanisms that determine high mitotic activity,
      identify tumor subtypes that carry molecular aberrations that confer high mitotic
      activity, and to develop molecular markers that distinguish which tumors will be 
      most responsive to mitotic apparatus inhibitors. Methods: We identified a
      coordinately regulated mitotic apparatus network by analyzing gene expression
      profiles for 53 malignant and non-malignant human breast cancer cell lines and
      two separate primary breast tumor datasets. We defined the mitotic network
      activity index (MNAI) as the sum of the transcriptional levels of the 54
      coordinately regulated mitotic apparatus genes. The effect of those genes on cell
      growth was evaluated by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Results: High MNAI was
      enriched in basal-like breast tumors and was associated with reduced survival
      duration and preferential sensitivity to inhibitors of the mitotic apparatus
      proteins, polo-like kinase, centromere associated protein E and aurora kinase
      designated GSK462364, GSK923295 and GSK1070916, respectively. Co-amplification of
      regions of chromosomes 8q24, 10p15-p12, 12p13, and 17q24-q25 was associated with 
      the transcriptional upregulation of this network of 54 mitotic apparatus genes,
      and we identify transcription factors that localize to these regions and
      putatively regulate mitotic activity. Knockdown of the mitotic network by siRNA
      identified 22 genes that might be considered as additional therapeutic targets
      for this clinically relevant patient subgroup. Conclusions: We define a molecular

AB  - The genomic landscape of breast cancer is complex, and inter- and intra-tumour
      heterogeneity are important challenges in treating the disease. In this study, we
      sequence 173 genes in 2,433 primary breast tumours that have copy number
      aberration (CNA), gene expression and long-term clinical follow-up data. We
      identify 40 mutation-driver (Mut-driver) genes, and determine associations
      between mutations, driver CNA profiles, clinical-pathological parameters and
      survival. We assess the clonal states of Mut-driver mutations, and estimate
      levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity using mutant-allele fractions. Associations 
      between PIK3CA mutations and reduced survival are identified in three subgroups
      of ER-positive cancer (defined by amplification of 17q23, 11q13–14 or 8q24). High
      levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity are in general associated with a worse
      outcome, but highly aggressive tumours with 11q13–14 amplification have low
      levels of intra-tumour heterogeneity. These results emphasize the importance of
      genome-based stratification of breast cancer, and have important implications for
      designing therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Frequent somatic transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome of human
      cancer cells.
PG  - 814-24
AB  - Mitochondrial genomes are separated from the nuclear genome for most of the cell 
      cycle by the nuclear double membrane, intervening cytoplasm, and the
      mitochondrial double membrane. Despite these physical barriers, we show that
      somatically acquired mitochondrial-nuclear genome fusion sequences are present in
      cancer cells. Most occur in conjunction with intranuclear genomic rearrangements,
      and the features of the fusion fragments indicate that nonhomologous end joining 
      and/or replication-dependent DNA double-strand break repair are the dominant
      mechanisms involved. Remarkably, mitochondrial-nuclear genome fusions occur at a 
      similar rate per base pair of DNA as interchromosomal nuclear rearrangements,
      indicating the presence of a high frequency of contact between mitochondrial and 
      nuclear DNA in some somatic cells. Transmission of mitochondrial DNA to the
      nuclear genome occurs in neoplastically transformed cells, but we do not exclude 
      the possibility that some mitochondrial-nuclear DNA fusions observed in cancer
      occurred years earlier in normal somatic cells.

TI  - Dynamics of genomic clones in breast cancer patient xenografts at single cell
      resolution.
PG  - 422-6
AB  - Human cancers, including breast cancers, are comprised of clones differing in
      mutation content. Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following
      principles of Darwinian evolution1,2, underpinning important emergent features
      such as drug resistance and metastasis3–7. Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is
      used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour
      xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating
      tumours8–10. However the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and
      propagation on the genomic clonal architecture of tumours has not been
      systematically examined at single cell resolution. Here we show by both deep
      genome and single cell sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial
      engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic human
      breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal
      selection on engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast
      tumours, varying in degree from extreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of
      starting population) clones to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore,
      ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature of tumours
      experiencing modest initial selection. Through single cell sequencing, we show
      that major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate
      predictably to the most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and
      rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show that similar clonal expansion patterns
      can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting tumour population,
      indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of
      evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically
      defined clonal population dynamics will be highly informative for functional
      studies utilizing patient-derived breast cancer xenoengraftment.

TI  - TITAN: inference of copy number architectures in clonal cell populations from
      tumor whole-genome sequence data.
PG  - 1881-93
AB  - The evolution of cancer genomes within a single tumor creates mixed cell
      populations with divergent somatic mutational landscapes. Inference of tumor
      subpopulations has been disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic
      point mutations, whereas computational methods targeting evolutionary dynamics of
      copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in whole-genome
      sequencing data remain underdeveloped. We present a novel probabilistic model,
      TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell
      populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We 
      evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from
      whole-genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites
      collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of
      breast tumors that the inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically informs
      population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we
      experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient
      sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.

TI  - Up-regulation of the interferon-related genes in BRCA2 knockout epithelial cells.
PG  - 386-97
AB  - BRCA2 mutations are significantly associated with early onset breast cancer, and 
      the tumour suppressing function of BRCA2 has been attributed to its involvement
      in homologous recombination [1]-mediated DNA repair. In order to identify
      additional functions of BRCA2, we generated BRCA2-knockout HCT116 human
      colorectal carcinoma cells. Using genome-wide microarray analyses, we have
      discovered a link between the loss of BRCA2 and the up-regulation of a subset of 
      interferon (IFN)-related genes, including APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G. The
      over-expression of IFN-related genes was confirmed in different human BRCA2−/−
      and mouse Brca2−/− tumour cell lines, and was independent of either senescence or
      apoptosis. In isogenic wild type BRCA2 cells, we observed over-expression of
      IFN-related genes after treatment with DNA-damaging agents, and following
      ionizing radiation. Cells with endogenous DNA damage because of defective BRCA1
      or RAD51 also exhibited over-expression of IFN-related genes. Transcriptional
      activity of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) was increased in BRCA2
      knockout cells, and the expression of BRCA2 greatly decreased IFN-α stimulated
      ISRE reporter activity, suggesting that BRCA2 directly represses the expression
      of IFN-related genes through the ISRE. Finally, the colony forming capacity of
      BRCA2 knockout cells was significantly reduced in the presence of either IFN-β or
      IFN-γ, suggesting that IFNs may have potential as therapeutic agents in cancer
      cells with BRCA2 mutations.

TI  - Genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer validated in over 7,500 
      samples.
LID - 431
AB  - Background: IntClust is a classification of breast cancer comprising 10 subtypes 
      based on molecular drivers identified through the integration of genomic and
      transcriptomic data from 1,000 breast tumors and validated in a further 1,000. We
      present a reliable method for subtyping breast tumors into the IntClust subtypes 
      based on gene expression and demonstrate the clinical and biological validity of 
      the IntClust classification. Results: We developed a gene expression-based
      approach for classifying breast tumors into the ten IntClust subtypes by using
      the ensemble profile of the index discovery dataset. We evaluate this approach in
      983 independent samples for which the combined copy-number and gene expression
      IntClust classification was available. Only 24 samples are discordantly
      classified. Next, we compile a consolidated external dataset composed of a
      further 7,544 breast tumors. We use our approach to classify all samples into the
      IntClust subtypes. All ten subtypes are observable in most studies at comparable 
      frequencies. The IntClust subtypes are significantly associated with relapse-free
      survival and recapitulate patterns of survival observed previously. In studies of
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, IntClust reveals distinct patterns of
      chemosensitivity. Finally, patterns of expression of genomic drivers reported by 
      TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) are better explained by IntClust as compared to
      the PAM50 classifier. Conclusions: IntClust subtypes are reproducible in a large 
      meta-analysis, show clinical validity and best capture variation in genomic
      drivers. IntClust is a driver-based breast cancer classification and is likely to
      become increasingly relevant as more targeted biological therapies become
      available. Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article

AB  - Complex focal chromosomal rearrangements in cancer genomes, also called
      “firestorms”, can be scored from DNA copy number data. The complex arm‐wise
      aberration index (CAAI) is a score that captures DNA copy number alterations that
      appear as focal complex events in tumors, and has potential prognostic value in
      breast cancer. This study aimed to validate this DNA‐based prognostic index in
      breast cancer and test for the first time its potential prognostic value in
      ovarian cancer. Copy number alteration (CNA) data from 1950 breast carcinomas
      (METABRIC cohort) and 508 high‐grade serous ovarian carcinomas (TCGA dataset)
      were analyzed. Cases were classified as CAAI positive if at least one complex
      focal event was scored. Complex alterations were frequently localized on
      chromosome 8p (n = 159), 17q (n = 176) and 11q (n = 251). CAAI events on 11q were
      most frequent in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases and on 17q in estrogen
      receptor negative (ER−) cases. We found only a modest correlation between CAAI
      and the overall rate of genomic instability (GII) and number of breakpoints
      (r = 0.27 and r = 0.42, p < 0.001). Breast cancer specific survival (BCSS),
      overall survival (OS) and ovarian cancer progression free survival (PFS) were
      used as clinical end points in Cox proportional hazard model survival analyses.
      CAAI positive breast cancers (43%) had higher mortality: hazard ratio (HR) of
      1.94 (95%CI, 1.62–2.32) for BCSS, and of 1.49 (95%CI, 1.30–1.71) for OS.
      Representations of the 70‐gene and the 21‐gene predictors were compared with CAAI
      in multivariable models and CAAI was independently significant with a Cox
      adjusted HR of 1.56 (95%CI, 1.23–1.99) for ER+ and 1.55 (95%CI, 1.11–2.18) for
      ER− disease. None of the expression‐based predictors were prognostic in the ER−
      subset. We found that a model including CAAI and the two expression‐based
      prognostic signatures outperformed a model including the 21‐gene and 70‐gene
      signatures but excluding CAAI. Inclusion of CAAI in the clinical prognostication 
      tool PREDICT significantly improved its performance. CAAI positive ovarian
      cancers (52%) also had worse prognosis: HRs of 1.3 (95%CI, 1.1–1.7) for PFS and
      1.3 (95%CI, 1.1–1.6) for OS. This study validates CAAI as an independent
      predictor of survival in both ER+ and ER− breast cancer and reveals a significant
      prognostic value for CAAI in high‐grade serous ovarian cancer.

TI  - PyClone: Statistical inference of clonal population structure in cancer.
PG  - 396-8
AB  - We introduce a novel statistical method, PyClone, for inference of clonal
      population structures in cancers. PyClone is a Bayesian clustering method for
      grouping sets of deeply sequenced somatic mutations into putative clonal clusters
      while estimating their cellular prevalences and accounting for allelic imbalances
      introduced by segmental copy number changes and normal cell contamination. Single
      cell sequencing validation demonstrates that PyClone infers accurate clustering
      of mutations that co-occur in individual cells.

TI  - The Breast Cancer Oncogene EMSY Represses Transcription of Antimetastatic
      microRNA miR-31.
PG  - 806-18
AB  - Amplification of the EMSY gene in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers is a poor
      prognostic indicator. Although EMSY has been linked to transcriptional silencing,
      its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we report that EMSY acts as an
      oncogene, causing the transformation of cells in vitro and potentiating tumor
      formation and metastatic features in vivo. We identify an inverse correlation
      between EMSY amplification and miR-31 expression, an antimetastatic microRNA, in 
      the METABRIC cohort of human breast samples. Re-expression of miR-31 profoundly
      reduced cell migration, invasion, and colony-formation abilities of cells
      overexpressing EMSY or haboring EMSY amplification. We show that EMSY is
      recruited to the miR-31 promoter by the DNA binding factor ETS-1, and it
      represses miR-31 transcription by delivering the H3K4me3 demethylase
      JARID1b/PLU-1/KDM5B. Altogether, these results suggest a pathway underlying the
      role of EMSY in breast cancer and uncover potential diagnostic and therapeutic
      targets in sporadic breast cancer.

TI  - Solution NMR Structure and Histone Binding of the PHD Domain of Human MLL5.
LID - e77020
AB  - Mixed Lineage Leukemia 5 (MLL5) is a histone methyltransferase that plays a key
      role in hematopoiesis, spermatogenesis and cell cycle progression. In addition to
      its catalytic domain, MLL5 contains a PHD finger domain, a protein module that is
      often involved in binding to the N-terminus of histone H3. Here we report the NMR
      solution structure of the MLL5 PHD domain showing a variant of the canonical PHD 
      fold that combines conserved H3 binding features from several classes of other
      PHD domains (including an aromatic cage) along with a novel C-terminal α-helix,
      not previously seen. We further demonstrate that the PHD domain binds with
      similar affinity to histone H3 tail peptides di- and tri-methylated at lysine 4
      (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3), the former being the putative product of the MLL5
      catalytic reaction. This work establishes the PHD domain of MLL5 as a bone fide
      ‘reader’ domain of H3K4 methyl marks suggesting that it may guide the spreading
      or further methylation of this site on chromatin.

TI  - Improving Breast Cancer Survival Analysis through Competition-Based
      Multidimensional Modeling.
LID - e1003047
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and is responsible for
      hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. As with most cancers, it is a
      heterogeneous disease and different breast cancer subtypes are treated
      differently. Understanding the difference in prognosis for breast cancer based on
      its molecular and phenotypic features is one avenue for improving treatment by
      matching the proper treatment with molecular subtypes of the disease. In this
      work, we employed a competition-based approach to modeling breast cancer
      prognosis using large datasets containing genomic and clinical information and an
      online real-time leaderboard program used to speed feedback to the modeling team 
      and to encourage each modeler to work towards achieving a higher ranked
      submission. We find that machine learning methods combined with molecular
      features selected based on expert prior knowledge can improve survival
      predictions compared to current best-in-class methodologies and that ensemble
      models trained across multiple user submissions systematically outperform
      individual models within the ensemble. We also find that model scores are highly 
      consistent across multiple independent evaluations. This study serves as the
      pilot phase of a much larger competition open to the whole research community,
      with the goal of understanding general strategies for model optimization using
      clinical and molecular profiling data and providing an objective, transparent
      system for assessing prognostic models.

      the basis of gene expression data, copy number data, and clinical covariates.
      This approach offered the opportunity to assess whether a crowdsourced community 
      Challenge would generate models of breast cancer prognosis commensurate with or
      exceeding current best-in-class approaches. The BCC comprised multiple rounds of 
      blinded evaluations on held-out portions of data on 1981 patients, resulting in
      more than 1400 models submitted as open source code. Participants then retrained 
      their models on the full data set of 1981 samples and submitted up to five models
      for validation in a newly generated data set of 184 breast cancer patients.
      Analysis of the BCC results suggests that the best-performing modeling strategy
      outperformed previously reported methods in blinded evaluations; model
      performance was consistent across several independent evaluations; and
      aggregating community-developed models achieved performance on par with the
      best-performing individual models.

TI  - A new genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer and its
      implications.
PG  - 617-28
AB  - Breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases that show substantial
      variation in their molecular and clinical characteristics. This heterogeneity
      poses significant challenges not only in breast cancer management, but also in
      studying the biology of the disease. Recently, rapid progress has been made in
      understanding the genomic diversity of breast cancer. These advances led to the
      characterisation of a new genome-driven integrated classification of breast
      cancer, which substantially refines the existing classification systems currently
      used. The novel classification integrates molecular information on the genomic
      and transcriptomic landscapes of breast cancer to define 10 integrative clusters,
      each associated with distinct clinical outcomes and providing new insights into
      the underlying biology and potential molecular drivers. These findings have
      profound implications both for the individualisation of treatment approaches,
      bringing us a step closer to the realisation of personalised cancer management in
      breast cancer, but also provide a new framework for studying the underlying
      biology of each novel subtype.

TI  - Integrative analysis of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity and monoallelic
      expression at nucleotide resolution reveals disrupted pathways in triple-negative
      breast cancer.
PG  - 1995-2007
AB  - Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) feature prominently
      in the somatic genomic landscape of tumors. As such, karyotypic aberrations in
      cancer genomes have been studied extensively to discover novel oncogenes and
      tumor-suppressor genes. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the
      cost-effective detection of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at
      single-base-pair resolution; however, computational methods for predicting
      segmental regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored.
      Consequently, whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of
      monoallelic expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken
      in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from paired
      tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23 triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive benchmarking experiments, we
      describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape of LOH in TNBC and assess the
      consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes of these tumors using
      RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific expression. We show that the
      majority of monoallelic expression in the transcriptomes of triple-negative
      breast cancer can be explained by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper
      bound for monoallelic expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific
      modifications such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes
      associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination and
      actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH in TNBC. Finally, we
      show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret allele frequencies of somatic 
      mutations and postulate on temporal ordering of mutations in the evolutionary
      history of these tumors.

      GTL16 Cells though MAPK Activation.
LID - e39653
AB  - Targeting cancers with amplified or abnormally activated c-Met (hepatocyte growth
      factor receptor) may have therapeutic benefit based on nonclinical and emerging
      clinical findings. However, the eventual emergence of drug resistant tumors
      motivates the pre-emptive identification of potential mechanisms of clinical
      resistance. We rendered a MET amplified gastric cancer cell line, GTL16,
      resistant to c-Met inhibition with prolonged exposure to a c-Met inhibitor,
      PF-04217903 (METi). Characterization of surviving cells identified an amplified
      chromosomal rearrangement between 7q32 and 7q34 which overexpresses a
      constitutively active SND1-BRAF fusion protein. In the resistant clones,
      hyperactivation of the downstream MAPK pathway via SND1-BRAF conferred resistance
      to c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition. Combination treatment with METi and
      a RAF inhibitor, PF-04880594 (RAFi) inhibited ERK activation and circumvented
      resistance to either single agent. Alternatively, treatment with a MEK inhibitor,
      PD-0325901 (MEKi) alone effectively blocked ERK phosphorylation and inhibited
      cell growth. Our results suggest that combination of a c-Met tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor with a BRAF or a MEK inhibitor may be effective in treating resistant
      tumors that use activated BRAF to escape suppression of c-Met signaling.

TI  - The Life History of 21 Breast Cancers.
PG  - 994-1007
AB  - Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by
      shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes.
      These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted
      in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this
      narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve
      across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive
      genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are
      found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal
      lineage, representing more than 50% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these
      subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, 
      implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of
      substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion
      of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final
      rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.

TI  - JointSNVMix: a probabilistic model for accurate detection of somatic mutations in
      normal/tumour paired next-generation sequencing data.
PG  - 907-13
AB  - Motivation: Identification of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in tumour
      genomes is a necessary step in defining the mutational landscapes of cancers.
      Experimental designs for genome-wide ascertainment of somatic mutations now
      routinely include next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour DNA and matched
      constitutional DNA from the same individual. This allows investigators to control
      for germline polymorphisms and distinguish somatic mutations that are unique to
      the tumour, thus reducing the burden of labour-intensive and expensive downstream
      experiments needed to verify initial predictions. In order to make full use of
      such paired datasets, computational tools for simultaneous analysis of
      tumour–normal paired sequence data are required, but are currently
      under-developed and under-represented in the bioinformatics literature.Results:
      In this contribution, we introduce two novel probabilistic graphical models
      called JointSNVMix1 and JointSNVMix2 for jointly analysing paired tumour–normal
      digital allelic count data from NGS experiments. In contrast to independent
      analysis of the tumour and normal data, our method allows statistical strength to
      be borrowed across the samples and therefore amplifies the statistical power to
      identify and distinguish both germline and somatic events in a unified
      probabilistic framework.Availability: The JointSNVMix models and four other
      models discussed in the article are part of the JointSNVMix software package
      available for download at
      http://compbio.bccrc.caContact:sshah@bccrc.caSupplementary

TI  - High-throughput microfluidic single-cell RT-qPCR.
PG  - 13999-4004
AB  - A long-sought milestone in microfluidics research has been the development of
      integrated technology for scalable analysis of transcription in single cells.
      Here we present a fully integrated microfluidic device capable of performing
      high-precision RT-qPCR measurements of gene expression from hundreds of single
      cells per run. Our device executes all steps of single-cell processing, including
      cell capture, cell lysis, reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR. In
      addition to higher throughput and reduced cost, we show that nanoliter volume
      processing reduced measurement noise, increased sensitivity, and provided single 
      nucleotide specificity. We apply this technology to 3,300 single-cell
      measurements of (i) miRNA expression in K562 cells, (ii) coregulation of a miRNA 
      and one of its target transcripts during differentiation in embryonic stem cells,
      and (iii) single nucleotide variant detection in primary lobular breast cancer
      cells. The core functionality established here provides the foundation from which
      a variety of on-chip single-cell transcription analyses will be developed.

TI  - The testosterone-dependent and independent transcriptional networks in the
      hypothalamus of Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout male mice are not fully equivalent.
PG  - 209
AB  - Background: Humans and mice with loss of function mutations in GPR54 (KISS1R) or 
      kisspeptin do not progress through puberty, caused by a failure to release GnRH. 
      The transcriptional networks regulated by these proteins in the hypothalamus have
      yet to be explored by genome-wide methods. Results: We show here, using 1 million
      exon mouse arrays (Exon 1.0 Affymetrix) and quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction (QPCR) validation to analyse microdissected hypothalamic tissue from
      Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout mice, the extent of transcriptional regulation in the
      hypothalamus. The sensitivity to detect important transcript differences in
      microdissected RNA was confirmed by the observation of counter-regulation of
      Kiss1 expression in Gpr54 knockouts and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
      Since Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout animals are effectively pre-pubertal with low
      testosterone (T) levels, we also determined which of the validated transcripts
      were T-responsive and which varied according to genotype alone. We observed four 
      types of transcriptional regulation (i) genotype only dependent regulation, (ii) 
      T only dependent regulation, (iii) genotype and T-dependent regulation with
      interaction between these variables, (iv) genotype and T-dependent regulation
      with no interaction between these variables. The results implicate for the first 
      time several transcription factors (e.g. Npas4, Esr2), proteases (Klk1b22), and
      the orphan 10-transmembrane transporter TMEM144 in the biology of
      GPR54/kisspeptin function in the hypothalamus. We show for the neuronal activity 
      regulated transcription factor NPAS4, that distinct protein over-expression is
      seen in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in Gpr54 knockout mice. This links for
      the first time the hypothalamic-gonadal axis with this important regulator of
      inhibitory synapse formation. Similarly we confirm TMEM144 up-regulation in the
      hypothalamus by RNA in situ hybridization and western blot. Conclusions: Taken
      together, global transcriptional profiling shows that loss of GPR54 and
      kisspeptin are not fully equivalent in the mouse hypothalamus.

TI  - ZNF703 is a common Luminal B breast cancer oncogene that differentially regulates
      luminal and basal progenitors in human mammary epithelium.
PG  - 167-80
AB  - The telomeric amplicon at 8p12 is common in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+)
      breast cancers. Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 primary breast tumours 
      revealed that ZNF703 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was
      amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to
      correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a
      distinct expression signature and poor clinical outcome. ZNF703 transformed NIH
      3T3 fibroblasts, behaving as a classical oncogene, and regulated proliferation in
      human luminal breast cancer cell lines and immortalized human mammary epithelial 
      cells. Manipulation of ZNF703 expression in the luminal MCF7 cell line modified
      the effects of TGFβ on proliferation. Overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human
      breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency of in vitro colony-forming cells
      from luminal progenitors. Taken together, these data strongly point to ZNF703 as 
      a novel oncogene in Luminal B breast cancer.

TI  - The Orphan Adhesion-GPCR GPR126 Is Required for Embryonic Development in the
      Mouse.
LID - e14047
AB  - Adhesion-GPCRs provide essential cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in
      development, and have been implicated in inherited human diseases like Usher
      Syndrome and bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. They are the second largest
      subfamily of seven-transmembrane spanning proteins in vertebrates, but the
      function of most of these receptors is still not understood. The orphan
      Adhesion-GPCR GPR126 has recently been shown to play an essential role in the
      myelination of peripheral nerves in zebrafish. In parallel, whole-genome
      association studies have implicated variation at the GPR126 locus as a
      determinant of body height in the human population. The physiological function of
      GPR126 in mammals is still unknown. We describe a targeted mutation of GPR126 in 
      the mouse, and show that GPR126 is required for embryonic viability and
      cardiovascular development.

TI  - Cooperative signaling between Wnt1 and integrin-linked kinase induces accelerated
      breast tumor development.
PG  - R38
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is genetically and clinically a heterogeneous
      disease. However, the exact contribution of different cell types and oncogenic
      mutations to this heterogeneity are not well understood. Recently, we discovered 
      an interaction between Wnt and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) within the signaling 
      cascade that regulates cell growth and survival. Interestingly, mammary-specific 
      expression of either one of these proteins has been shown to promote mammary
      tumorigenesis. In light of our recent findings and to investigate the potential
      interaction between Wnt and ILK proteins during mammary tumor formation and
      progression, we established a transgenic mouse model that expresses both Wnt and 
      ILK in mammary epithelial cells. Methods: A novel transgenic mouse model with
      mammary-specific expression of both Wnt1 and ILK was generated by crossing the
      two previously characterized mouse models, MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-ILK. The resulting 
      MMTV-Wnt/ILK mice were closely monitored for tumor development and growth, as
      well as for the tumor onset. The molecular phenotypes of both tumors and
      premalignant mammary glands were investigated by using biochemical and global
      gene-expression analysis approaches. Results: A significant acceleration in
      mammary tumor incidence and growth was observed in the MMTV-Wnt/ILK mice.
      Pre-neoplastic mammary glands also display lobuloalveolar hyperplasia and an
      increase in ductal epithelium proliferation. Apart from elevated expression of
      Wnt/ILK targets, such as β-catenin and cyclin D1, gene-expression profiling
      identified the surprising activation of the FOXA1 transcription factor.
      Upregulation of FOXA1, which is also known as the molecular marker of
      differentiated mammary luminal cells, was consistent with the expansion of the
      enriched luminal progenitor population or CD29loCD24hiCD61+ cells in MMTV-Wnt/ILK
      tumors. Conclusions: These results show cooperation between Wnt1 and ILK
      transgenes during mammary carcinogenesis, leading to changes in a transcriptional
      network, which could dictate a specific breast cancer phenotype with enhanced
      growth dynamics. The MMTV-Wnt/ILK can be used as a model to identify further the 
      genes downstream of the estrogen receptor-β/FOXA1 and to investigate the
      mechanisms targeting the expansion of the luminal progenitor cells leading to
      hyperplasia and tumorigenesis.

TI  - Human mammary cancer progression model recapitulates methylation events
      associated with breast premalignancy.
PG  - R87
AB  - Introduction: We have previously identified a rare subpopulation of variant human
      mammary epithelial cells (vHMEC) with repressed p16INK4A that exist in
      disease-free women yet display premalignant properties, suggesting that they have
      engaged the process of malignant transformation. In order to gain insight into
      the molecular alterations required for vHMEC to progress to malignancy, and to
      characterize the epigenetic events associated with early progression, we examined
      the effect of oncogenic stress on the behavior of these cells. Methods: HMEC that
      express p16INK4A and vHMEC that do not, were transduced with constitutively
      active Ha-rasV12 and subsequently exposed to serum to determine whether signals
      from the cellular microenvironment could cooperate with ras to promote the
      malignant transformation of vHMEC. Epigenetic alterations were assessed using
      methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: vHMEC expressing
      Ha-rasV12 (vHMEC-ras) bypassed the classic proliferative arrest that has been
      previously documented in normal fibroblasts following oncogenic stress, and that 
      we also observe here in normal HMEC. Moreover, vHMEC-ras cells exhibited many
      additional alterations that are observed during progression to malignancy such as
      the generation of chromosomal abnormalities, upregulation of telomerase activity,
      immortalization following exposure to serum, and anchorage-independent growth,
      but they did not form tumors following orthotopic injection in vivo. Associated
      with their early progression to malignancy was an increase in the number of genes
      methylated, two of which (RASSF1A and SFRP1) were also methylated in other
      immortalized mammary cell lines as well as in breast cancer cells and tissues.
      Conclusions: We have characterized a mammary progression model that recapitulates
      molecular and methylation alterations observed in many breast cancers. Our data
      suggest that concomitant methylation of RASSF1A and SFRP1 marks an early event in
      mammary transformation and may thus have prognostic potential.

TI  - Evolutionary concepts in biobanking - the BC BioLibrary.
PG  - 95
AB  - Background: Medical research to improve health care faces a major problem in the 
      relatively limited availability of adequately annotated and collected
      biospecimens. This limitation is creating a growing gap between the pace of
      scientific advances and successful exploitation of this knowledge. Biobanks are
      an important conduit for transfer of biospecimens (tissues, blood, body fluids)
      and related health data to research. They have evolved outside of the historical 
      source of tissue biospecimens, clinical pathology archives. Research biobanks
      have developed advanced standards, protocols, databases, and mechanisms to
      interface with researchers seeking biospecimens. However, biobanks are often
      limited in their capacity and ability to ensure quality in the face of increasing
      demand. Our strategy to enhance both capacity and quality in research biobanking 
      is to create a new framework that repatriates the activity of biospecimen accrual
      for biobanks to clinical pathology. Methods: The British Columbia (BC) BioLibrary
      is a framework to maximize the accrual of high-quality, annotated biospecimens
      into biobanks. The BC BioLibrary design primarily encompasses: 1) specialized
      biospecimen collection units embedded within clinical pathology and linked to a
      biospecimen distribution system that serves biobanks; 2) a systematic process to 
      connect potential donors with biobanks, and to connect biobanks with consented
      biospecimens; and 3) interdisciplinary governance and oversight informed by
      public opinion. Results: The BC BioLibrary has been embraced by biobanking
      leaders and translational researchers throughout BC, across multiple health
      authorities, institutions, and disciplines. An initial pilot network of three
      Biospecimen Collection Units has been successfully established. In addition, two 
      public deliberation events have been held to obtain input from the public on the 
      BioLibrary and on issues including consent, collection of biospecimens and
      governance. Conclusion: The BC BioLibrary framework addresses common issues for
      clinical pathology, biobanking, and translational research across multiple
      institutions and clinical and research domains. We anticipate that our framework 
      will lead to enhanced biospecimen accrual capacity and quality, reduced
      competition between biobanks, and a transparent process for donors that enhances 
      public trust in biobanking.

TI  - A loss of function allele for murine Staufen1 leads to impairment of dendritic
      Staufen1-RNP delivery and dendritic spine morphogenesis.
PG  - 16374-9
AB  - The dsRNA-binding protein Staufen was the first RNA-binding protein proven to
      play a role in RNA localization in Drosophila. A mammalian homolog, Staufen1
      (Stau1), has been implicated in dendritic RNA localization in neurons,
      translational control, and mRNA decay. However, the precise mechanisms by which
      it fulfills these specific roles are only partially understood. To determine its 
      physiological functions, the murine Stau1 gene was disrupted by homologous
      recombination. Homozygous stau1tm1Apa mutant mice express a truncated Stau1
      protein lacking the functional RNA-binding domain 3. The level of the truncated
      protein is significantly reduced. Cultured hippocampal neurons derived from
      stau1tm1Apa homozygous mice display deficits in dendritic delivery of Stau1-EYFP 
      and β-actin mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Furthermore,
      these neurons have a significantly reduced dendritic tree and develop fewer
      synapses. Homozygous stau1tm1Apa mutant mice are viable and show no obvious
      deficits in development, fertility, health, overall brain morphology, and a
      variety of behavioral assays, e.g., hippocampus-dependent learning. However, we
      did detect deficits in locomotor activity. Our data suggest that Stau1 is crucial
      for synapse development in vitro but not critical for normal behavioral function.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is transcriptionally induced by the Y-box
      binding protein-1 (YB-1) and can be inhibited with Iressa in basal-like breast
      cancer, providing a potential target for therapy.
PG  - R61
AB  - Introduction: Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) are very aggressive, and present 
      serious clinical challenges as there are currently no targeted therapies
      available. We determined the regulatory role of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) on
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in BLBC, and the
      therapeutic potential of inhibiting EGFR. We pursued this in light of our recent 
      work showing that YB-1 induces the expression of EGFR, a new BLBC marker.
      Methods: Primary tumour tissues were evaluated for YB1 protein expression by
      immunostaining tissue microarrays, while copy number changes were assessed by
      comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The ability of YB-1 to regulate EGFR was
      evaluated using luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and gel
      shift assays. The impact of Iressa on monolayer cell growth was measured using an
      ArrayScan VTI high-throughput analyser to count cell number, and colony formation
      in soft agar was used to measure anchorage-independent growth. Results: YB-1
      (27/37 or 73% of cases, P = 3.899 × 10-4) and EGFR (20/37 or 57.1% of cases, P = 
      9.206 × 10-12) are expressed in most cases of BLBC. However, they are not
      typically amplified in primary BLBC, suggesting overexpression owing to
      transcriptional activation. In support of this, we demonstrate that YB-1 promotes
      EGFR reporter activity. YB-1 specifically binds the EGFR promoter at two
      different YB-1-responsive elements (YREs) located at -940 and -968 using ChIP and
      gel shift assays in a manner that is dependent on the phosphorylation of S102 on 
      YB-1. Inhibiting EGFR with Iressa suppressed the growth of SUM149 cells by ~40%
      in monolayer, independent of mutations in the receptor. More importantly
      anchorage-independent growth of BLBC cell lines was inhibited with combinations
      of Iressa and YB-1 suppression. Conclusion: We have identified for the first time
      a causal link for the expression of EGFR in BLBC through the induction by YB-1
      where it binds specifically to two distinguished YREs. Finally, inhibition of
      EGFR in combination with suppression of YB-1 presents a potential opportunity for
      therapy in BLBC.

TI  - Systematic genome-wide annotation of spliceosomal proteins reveals differential
      gene family expansion.
PG  - 66-77
AB  - Although more than 200 human spliceosomal and splicing-associated proteins are
      known, the evolution of the splicing machinery has not been studied extensively. 
      The recent near-complete sequencing and annotation of distant vertebrate and
      chordate genomes provides the opportunity for an exhaustive comparative analysis 
      of splicing factors across eukaryotes. We describe here our semiautomated
      computational pipeline to identify and annotate splicing factors in
      representative species of eukaryotes. We focused on protein families whose role
      in splicing is confirmed by experimental evidence. We visually inspected 1894
      proteins and manually curated 224 of them. Our analysis shows a general
      conservation of the core spliceosomal proteins across the eukaryotic lineage,
      contrasting with selective expansions of protein families known to play a role in
      the regulation of splicing, most notably of SR proteins in metazoans and of
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) in vertebrates. We also observed
      vertebrate-specific expansion of the CLK and SRPK kinases (which phosphorylate SR
      proteins), and the CUG-BP/CELF family of splicing regulators. Furthermore, we
      report several intronless genes amongst splicing proteins in mammals, suggesting 
      that retrotransposition contributed to the complexity of the mammalian splicing
      apparatus.

TI  - Kisspeptin directly stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone release via G
      protein-coupled receptor 54.
PG  - 1761-6
AB  - We have recently described a molecular gatekeeper of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis with the observation that G protein-coupled
      receptor 54 (GPR54) is required in mice and men for the pubertal onset of
      pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
      secretion to occur. In the present study, we investigate the possible central
      mode of action of GPR54 and kisspeptin ligand. First, we show that GPR54
      transcripts are colocalized with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in
      the mouse hypothalamus, suggesting that kisspeptin, the GPR54 ligand, may act
      directly on these neurons. Next, we show that GnRH neurons seem anatomically
      normal in gpr54–/– mice, and that they show projections to the median eminence,
      which demonstrates that the hypogonadism in gpr54–/– mice is not due to an
      abnormal migration of GnRH neurons (as occurs with KAL1 mutations), but that it
      is more likely due to a lack of GnRH release or absence of GnRH neuron
      stimulation. We also show that levels of kisspeptin injected i.p., which
      stimulate robust LH and FSH release in wild-type mice, have no effect in gpr54–/–
      mice, and therefore that kisspeptin acts directly and uniquely by means of GPR54 
      signaling for this function. Finally, we demonstrate by direct measurement, that 
      the central administration of kisspeptin intracerebroventricularly in sheep
      produces a dramatic release of GnRH into the cerebrospinal fluid, with a parallel
      rise in serum LH, demonstrating that a key action of kisspeptin on the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis occurs directly at the level of GnRH release. 
      The localization and GnRH release effects of kisspeptin thus define GPR54 as a
      major control point in the reproductive axis and suggest kisspeptin to be a
      neurohormonal effector.

AB  - Breast cancers differ in response to treatment and may have a divergent clinical 
      course despite having a similar histopathological appearance. New technology
      using DNA microarrays provides a systematic method to identify key markers for
      prognosis and treatment response by profiling thousands of genes expressed in a
      single cancer. Microarray profiling of 38 invasive breast cancers now confirms
      striking molecular differences between ductal carcinoma specimens and suggests a 
      new classification for oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Future
      approaches will need to include methods for high-throughput clinical validation
      and the ability to analyze microscopic samples.
