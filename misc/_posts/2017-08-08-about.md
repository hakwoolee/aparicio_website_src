# The Shah Lab
We are a computational cancer biology lab interested in dissecting fundamental properties of cancer evolution.  We use high resolution genomics to study human cancers, coupling these measurements with innovation in computational methods to infer cancer biology at genome and single cell scales. The lab is led by Dr. Sohrab Shah, who is appointed as Associate Professor at UBC and Senior Scientist at BC Cancer.  He holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Cancer Genomics and is a UBC Killam laureate. Our lab is located in beautiful Vancouver, BC at the BC Cancer Agency.  Our research overview can be found [here](http://shahlab.ca/research) and our papers are listed [here](http://shahlab.ca/papers/).
