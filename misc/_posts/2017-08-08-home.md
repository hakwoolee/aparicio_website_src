The Aparicio Lab is an international computational cancer biology lab
dedicated to dissecting fundamental properties of cancer evolution. The
lab is led by [Dr. Samuel Aparicio](https://molonc.github.io/team/Aparicio-Samuel) and
has on-site locations both at the [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York and at [BC
Cancer](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/) in Vancouver.

At the Aparicio Lab, we use high resolution genomics to study human cancers,
and couple these measurements with innovation in computational methods
to infer cancer biology at genome and single-cell scales. An overview of
our research can be found [here](https://molonc.github.io/research) and our
publications are listed [here](https://molonc.github.io/papers).
