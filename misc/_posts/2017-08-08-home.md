The Aparicio Lab is an international computational cancer biology lab
dedicated to dissecting fundamental properties of cancer evolution. The
lab is led by [Dr. Samuel Aparicio](https://molonc.github.io/team/Aparicio-Samuel) and
has an on-site location at the [BC
Cancer](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/) Agency in Vancouver.

At the Aparicio Lab, we use high resolution genomics to study human cancers,
and couple these measurements with innovation in computational methods
to infer cancer biology at genome and single-cell scales. An overview of
our research can be found [here](https://molonc.github.io/research) and our
publications are listed [here](https://molonc.github.io/papers).
