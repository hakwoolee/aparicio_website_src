The Shah Lab is an international computational cancer biology dedicated
to dissecting fundamental properties of cancer evolution. The lab is led
by [Dr. Sohrab Shah](http://shahlab.ca/team/Sohrab-Shah), and has
on-site locations both at the [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York and at [BC
Cancer](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/) in Vancouver.

At the Shah Lab, we use high resolution genomics to study human cancers,
and couple these measurements with innovation in computational methods
to infer cancer biology at genome and single-cell scales. An overview of
our research can be found [here](http://shahlab.ca/research) and our
publications are listed [here](http://shahlab.ca/papers).  If you are
interested in joining the lab, please visit [this
page](http://shahlab.ca/join) for more information about training and
career opportunities.
