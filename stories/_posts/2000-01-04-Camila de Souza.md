My research program consists of developing new statistical methods to analyze large and complex data structures arising from various areas in the Natural Sciences, Health, and Engineering. I conduct research on techniques involving clustering, hierarchical mixture models, mixed effect models, hidden Markov models, nonparametric regression, semi-parametric models, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and Bayesian variational inference. I am particularly interested in applications comprising single-cell sequencing data, and electrical energy consumption data.
