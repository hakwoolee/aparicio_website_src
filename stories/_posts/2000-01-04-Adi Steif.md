During her PhD at UBC in Vancouver, Canada, Adi established herself as a promising cancer researcher. She made contributions to the understanding of breast cancer evolution and methods for single-cell whole genome sequencing. Adi worked with Prof John Marioni in Cambridge, UK and used her placement as a Schmidt Science Fellow to develop her skills in probabilistic modeling and machine learning.

Adi brought together her experience in cancer research and advances in computational approaches together to generate new insights into single-cell biology during normal development and early carcinogenesis. After completing her fellowship, Adi continues her work as a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
