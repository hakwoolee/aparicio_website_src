The successful applicant will work full-time under the supervision of Dr. Samuel Aparicio. The position start date is flexible.</p>

<p>JOB SUMMARY:</p>

<p>The Aparicio lab is developing new single cell genome and transcriptome methods for tracking clonal trajectories at single cell level in patient tissues and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). A PDF position is available in the Aparicio lab based at the BC Cancer Research Center in Vancouver, Canada, collaborating on an exciting project mapping clonal dynamics in human cancers with new single cell methods. The post holder will have the opportunity to interact as part of the international CRUK Grand Challenge IMAXT project, bringing new measurement methods and computational techniques to the 3D reconstruction of tumours, and mapping drug sensitivity and drug combinations using sgRNA/CRISPR methods in vivo. The program works closely with the Shah computational biology program, based at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, on the development of new models for single cell data and cancer evolution. Some experience with bioinformatics approaches to biological data and familiarity with handling of genomics data will be an advantage.</p>

<p>ORGANIZATIONAL STATUS:</p>

<p>Aparicio Lab is located in the department of Molecular Oncology at BC Cancer Research Center in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The candidate will report directly to Dr. Samuel Aparicio, and will play a senior leadership role in the laboratory.</p>
